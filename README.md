**Project Title:** AI-Powered SOC Controls Insights & Testing Assistant  

---

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction
SOC1 and SOC2 audits are essential for evaluating how well an organization manages information security, financial reporting controls, and compliance. These audits typically involve analyzing a large volume of documents, policies, control evidence, and testing reports.

The traditional approach is **manual, time-intensive, and prone to human error**. This project leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to build an assistant that automates:

- Document ingestion and understanding  
- Control evidence summarization  
- Mapping findings to **SOC2 Trust Principles**  
- Draft report generation for auditors

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:

1. **Automate Document Ingestion** â€“ Handle multiple file formats like **PDF, DOCX, XLSX**.  
2. **Summarize Evidence** â€“ Generate concise summaries of control-related documents.  
3. **Map Risks & Controls** â€“ Align findings with SOC2 Trust Principles:  
   - Security  
   - Availability  
   - Processing Integrity  
   - Confidentiality  
   - Privacy  
4. **Generate Draft Reports** â€“ Automatically create structured compliance reports with risks, insights, and recommendations.

## ðŸ”„ System Workflow

### 1) Document Ingestion
- Audit reports, policies, and evidence are uploaded into the system.  
- Supports multiple formats (**PDF, DOCX, XLSX**).

### 2) Data Processing
- Long documents are divided into smaller, manageable sections (**chunks**).  
- Each section is indexed in a **vector database** for efficient retrieval.

### 3) Evidence Summarization
- AI models extract key insights from the evidence.  
- Summaries highlight **control effectiveness, weaknesses, and gaps**.

### 4) Risk & Control Mapping
- Findings are automatically mapped to relevant **SOC2 Trust Principles**.  
- Helps auditors identify **areas of non-compliance** or **potential risk**.

### 5) Draft Report Generation
- The assistant generates **structured draft audit reports** containing:  
  - Key risks identified  
  - Relevant SOC2 principle mapping  
  - Recommended corrective actions  

###Business Implications

_Audit Efficiency â†’ Reduces manual review time by 60â€“70%, accelerating audits.
-Improved Accuracy â†’ Ensures complete coverage of SOC2 principles without oversight.
-Risk Visibility â†’ Provides early identification of weak or missing controls.
-Cost Savings â†’ Reduces the time and resources required for manual audits.
-Scalability â†’ Capable of analyzing hundreds of compliance documents automatically.
-Decision Support â†’ Empowers management and audit teams with actionable intelligence.
